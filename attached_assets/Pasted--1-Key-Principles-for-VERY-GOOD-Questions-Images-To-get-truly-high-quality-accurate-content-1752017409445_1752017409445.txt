üî• 1. Key Principles for ‚ÄúVERY GOOD‚Äù Questions & Images

To get truly high-quality, accurate content, you need:

Well-curated base content (templates & rules for factual correctness)
Human-in-the-loop QA (automated generation + expert review loop)
Powerful, specialized AI models fine-tuned for your domain (e.g., Grade 5 math vs. AP Bio)
Good prompt engineering if using LLMs
Image generation guardrails (templates + generative models + human checks)
Context-aware generation (the AI should ‚Äúknow‚Äù the learner‚Äôs level)
‚úÖ 2. Enhanced Tech Stack

Here‚Äôs an upgraded backend stack that gets you high quality questions, images, AND text-to-speech:

Layer	Best Tech	Why
Backend API	Python (FastAPI) or Node.js (Express)	Flexible, scalable, easy to connect AI pipelines
Database	PostgreSQL + vector DB (Pinecone, Weaviate)	Store questions, user history, embeddings for similarity search
AI/ML for Questions	OpenAI GPT-4/4o, plus custom fine-tuned models on domain-specific data	General + domain-accurate generation
Image Generation	OpenAI‚Äôs DALL¬∑E, Midjourney, or custom diffusion models	Generate diagrams or visual aids
Image Templates	For structured content (charts, math graphs) use Matplotlib, Desmos API, or Chart.js	Accurate visual representation
Quality Control	Automated validation + human-in-the-loop pipeline	Reduces hallucinations & factual errors
Text-to-Audio	Google Cloud Text-to-Speech, Amazon Polly, or ElevenLabs	Natural, clear voice for read-aloud
CMS	Custom or headless (Strapi, Contentful)	Control templates & human review workflow
Orchestration	Serverless (AWS Lambda) or Kubernetes	Scales AI calls & image generation
Delivery	REST or GraphQL APIs	Serve questions & assets to frontend apps
‚ú® 3. How This Works in Practice

Example Flow
Student clicks ‚ÄúNext Question‚Äù
Backend checks user progress ‚Üí picks topic ‚Üí chooses generation path:
Templated? Plug variables.
AI-generated? Send prompt to LLM.
For images:
If simple (e.g., geometry figure): auto-generate SVG/PNG using math libraries.
If complex (e.g., science diagram): call DALL¬∑E with strict prompt, verify.
For text-to-audio:
Pass question text to Google TTS ‚Üí save MP3 or stream.
Validate output (logic checks, rule checks, maybe a final human check for new items).
Deliver question, image, audio to frontend.
