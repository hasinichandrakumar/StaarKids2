# StaarKids Google Authentication System

## Overview

StaarKids uses Google OAuth 2.0 authentication to provide secure, convenient access for students, parents, and educators. This system leverages Google's trusted authentication infrastructure while maintaining strict privacy and security standards for educational use.

## How Google Authentication Works

### User Login Process
1. **Login Initiation**: Users click "Sign in with Google" on the StaarKids homepage
2. **Google Redirect**: Users are redirected to Google's secure authentication servers
3. **Credential Verification**: Google verifies the user's identity using their existing Google account
4. **Permission Consent**: Users grant StaarKids permission to access basic profile information
5. **Account Creation**: StaarKids automatically creates or updates the user profile
6. **Session Establishment**: A secure session is created for the authenticated user
